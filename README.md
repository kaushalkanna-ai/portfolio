This repository houses the source code for my personal executive portfolio. It is engineered to be a living dashboard of my work, combining engineering leadership case studies with strategic thought leadership in a unified, high-performance interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Unified Impact Dashboard
Moved away from traditional "Projects vs. Blog" silos. The **Selected Work** section features a seamless tabbed interface switching between:
- **Engineering:** Technical execution and architecture diagrams.
- **Strategy:** Thought leadership and organizational design.

### 2. Executive Aesthetic
A clean, minimalist design language that supports Dark Mode out of the box. Features subtle micro-interactions, glassmorphism effects, and a custom particle background without compromising readability.

### 3. Developer Soul
Includes an interactive **Console Welcome** component that greets fellow engineers in the browser's developer tools—a nod to my technical roots.
